We chose to use the MIT License because we wanted our software to be available to everyone. Since we are no longer updating or maintaining the program and it is a simple program there is no reason for us to restrict the use of our code. If people want to use our code base for their own projects and profit of them they can rightfully do so. The Code of Conduct is there so we can monitor the code base incase someone decides to change the codebase in order for it to produce or do something offensive or unacceptable. If that is the case it is our responsibility to reject the offensive edit and ban the user who contributed it.
